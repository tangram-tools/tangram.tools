Base site: Tangram.tools

I am currently using Framer for my website tangram.tools

I would like to move away from this paid solution and would like to build and host my own site. 

I want to take all the content that has been created on the framer site (found at tangram.tools) and rebuild it in this repository. 


Great — you're looking to migrate your website from Framer to a self-hosted solution while preserving the existing content and structure. Here's a high-level plan to help you get started:

---

## ✅ Step 1: Evaluate & Plan

### 1.1. Audit the Current Site

Visit [tangram.tools](https://tangram.tools) and take note of:

* Pages (home, about, pricing, etc.)
* Components (hero sections, feature lists, testimonials, etc.)
* Design (fonts, colors, layout, animations)
* Images and assets (SVGs, PNGs, videos, etc.)
* Metadata (SEO tags, Open Graph, etc.)

Let me know if you'd like help auditing the current live site — I can analyze the content for you if needed.

### 1.2. Choose Your Tech Stack

Common self-hosted, developer-friendly stacks include:

* **Static site generators** like **Next.js**, **Astro**, **Eleventy**
* **Hosting** via **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or **GitHub Pages**
* **CMS (optional)**: Sanity, Contentlayer, or none (just Markdown/MDX)

I recommend **Next.js with Tailwind CSS** for flexibility and performance.

## ✅ Step 2: Set Up the Repo

### Folder Structure Example:

```
tangram.tools/
├── public/               # Images, favicon, etc.
├── pages/                # Routing (Next.js)
│   ├── index.tsx         # Homepage
│   └── ...
├── components/           # Reusable UI elements
├── styles/               # Tailwind config and global styles
├── data/                 # Optional: JSON or Markdown/MDX content
├── next.config.js        # Next.js configuration
└── tailwind.config.js    # Tailwind configuration
```

---

## ✅ Step 3: Extract & Rebuild Content

This part can be semi-automated:

1. **Export/Copy content** from Framer manually or via the browser DOM.
2. **Download images** from the site using the Network tab or tools like `wget`.
3. **Rebuild pages** in code using React components and Tailwind.
4. **Replicate animations** using Framer Motion or CSS if needed.

Would you like help with:

* A full clone of the tangram.tools content?
* Converting specific sections to React components?
* A GitHub repo scaffold?

---

## ✅ Step 4: Deploy

When done:

* Push to GitHub.
* Deploy to Vercel or Netlify (free tier is usually enough).
* Set up domain (point `tangram.tools` to the new hosting).

---

Would you like me to:

* Start scaffolding a basic version of your site (in Next.js + Tailwind)?
* Crawl the current site and extract the copy/images?
* Recreate specific pages/components?

Let me know how hands-on you want this help to be.
